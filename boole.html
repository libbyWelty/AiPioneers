    <h1>George Boole: The Father of the Information Age</h1>

    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Slide 1: Early Life of a Self-Taught Genius</h2>
        <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/George_Boole.max-1000x1000.jpeg" alt="Portrait of George Boole" style="max-width: 200px;">
        <p><strong>George Boole (1815-1864)</strong> was a largely self-taught English mathematician, philosopher, and logician.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Humble Beginnings:</strong> Born into a family of modest means, Boole had very little formal education. A true prodigy, he taught himself advanced mathematics, Latin, and Greek.</li>
            <li><strong>From Teacher to Professor:</strong> By age 20, he had opened his own school. Despite never attending a university himself, his groundbreaking research led to his appointment as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork, in Ireland.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Slide 2: Major Contribution - Boolean Algebra</h2>
        <p>Boole's most revolutionary work was his 1854 book, <strong><em>An Investigation of the Laws of Thought</em></strong>, where he introduced a new form of algebra.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logic as Math:</strong> Boole's great insight was that logic could be represented by mathematical equations. This system, now called <strong>Boolean Algebra</strong>, is based on a simple but powerful idea: variables can only have two values, <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong> (represented as 1 and 0).</li>
            <li><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> He used simple operators like <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, and <strong>NOT</strong> to create a complete system for logical calculation. For the first time, logic became a branch of mathematics.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Slide 3: The Language of Computers</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Boolean_logic_gates.svg/800px-Boolean_logic_gates.svg.png" alt="Diagram of Boolean Logic Gates">
        <p>Decades after his death, Boole's work found its ultimate application. In the 1930s, engineer Claude Shannon realized that the True/False (1/0) nature of Boolean logic perfectly described the On/Off states of an electrical circuit.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong> Every digital device—from a supercomputer to your smartphone—is built from millions or billions of tiny electronic switches (transistors) that operate according to the rules of Boolean algebra.</li>
            <li><strong>The Foundation of Hardware:</strong> These "logic gates" perform Boolean operations at incredible speeds, forming the physical basis of all modern computation.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Slide 4: Influence on Modern AI</h2>
        <p>While Boole never conceived of AI, he created its fundamental language. Every decision an AI makes is, at its most basic level, a series of Boolean calculations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Chain of Innovation:</strong> The path from his mind to modern AI is direct: <strong>Boole's Logic ➡️ The Digital Circuit ➡️ The Computer ➡️ Artificial Intelligence</strong></li>
            <li><strong>AI in Action:</strong> When a machine learning model classifies an image or a search engine finds a result, it is executing complex algorithms built upon billions of simple True/False questions. Boole's system provides the logical grammar for every "thought" a computer has.</li>
        </ul>
